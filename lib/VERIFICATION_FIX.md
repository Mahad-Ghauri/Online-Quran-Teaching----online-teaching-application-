# User Verification Field Fix

## Problem
Users created in Firestore were missing the `isVerified` field, which is required for the Qari verification system.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AuthService (`lib/services/auth_service.dart`)
- Added explicit verification that `isVerified` field is included when creating users
- Added helper method `_ensureIsVerifiedFieldExists()` to double-check field creation
- Added Flutter foundation import for debugPrint

### 2. Enhanced FirestoreService (`lib/services/firestore_service.dart`)
- Modified `createUserProfile()` to explicitly ensure `isVerified` field is included
- Added verification step to check document was created correctly
- Added fallback to force-add field if somehow missing

### 3. User Migration Utility (`lib/utils/user_migration.dart`)
- `addIsVerifiedFieldToAllUsers()` - Fix existing users without the field
- `verifySpecificQari()` - Manually verify a Qari
- `userHasIsVerifiedField()` - Check if user has the field
- `listAllUsersWithVerificationStatus()` - Debug all users
- `createUserWithVerificationField()` - Create user with guaranteed field
- `forceUpdateUserWithVerificationField()` - Force-add field to existing user

### 4. Test Utilities (`lib/test/user_creation_test.dart`)
- Test functions to verify new user creation works correctly
- UI widget to run tests from the app
- Verification that `isVerified` field exists in Firestore

## How to Use

### After Deleting Existing Users:

1. **Create new users normally through signup**:
   ```dart
   await AuthService.signUp(
     email: 'user@example.com',
     password: 'password123',
     name: 'User Name',
     role: UserRole.student, // or UserRole.qari
   );
   ```

2. **All new users will automatically have `isVerified: false`**

3. **To verify a Qari (admin action)**:
   ```dart
   await UserFieldMigration.verifySpecificQari(qariUserId);
   ```

### If You Still Have Existing Users:

1. **Run the migration to fix all users**:
   ```dart
   await UserFieldMigration.addIsVerifiedFieldToAllUsers();
   ```

2. **Check all users status**:
   ```dart
   await UserFieldMigration.listAllUsersWithVerificationStatus();
   ```

## Key Changes Made

- âœ… **AuthService**: Enhanced user creation with field verification
- âœ… **FirestoreService**: Bulletproof user profile creation
- âœ… **Migration Utility**: Tools to fix existing data
- âœ… **Test Suite**: Verify everything works correctly

## Default Values
- **Students**: `isVerified: false` (not used for students, but included for consistency)
- **Qaris**: `isVerified: false` (must be verified by admin before appearing in student lists)
- **Admins**: `isVerified: false` (admin status determined by role, not verification)

## Verification Workflow
1. Qari signs up â†’ `isVerified: false`
2. Qari cannot appear in student search results
3. Admin verifies Qari â†’ `isVerified: true`
4. Qari now appears in student search and can accept bookings

All new users will now have the `isVerified` field properly set! ðŸš€
